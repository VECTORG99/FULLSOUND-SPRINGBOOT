# Assets Overview

This directory contains various assets used throughout the project, including images, fonts, and other media files. 

## Organization

- **Images**: All image files should be stored in a dedicated subdirectory (e.g., `images/`) for easy access and management.
- **Fonts**: Custom fonts should be placed in a `fonts/` subdirectory to ensure they are easily referenced in the CSS files.
- **Other Media**: Any additional media files (e.g., videos, audio) should be organized in their respective subdirectories.

## Usage

When referencing assets in your application, ensure to use relative paths that point to the correct directories. This will help maintain a clean and organized structure, making it easier to manage and update assets as needed.
