# Testing Strategy for the Backend

This document outlines the testing strategy for the backend of the MVC project. It details the frameworks and tools used for testing, as well as the structure and organization of the tests.

## Testing Frameworks

- **Mocha**: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
- **Chai**: An assertion library that works with Mocha, providing a variety of assertion styles (should, expect, assert).
- **Supertest**: A library for testing HTTP servers in Node.js, allowing for easy testing of API endpoints.

## Test Structure

The backend tests are organized into the following directories:

- **unit**: Contains unit tests for individual functions and methods.
- **integration**: Contains integration tests that verify the interaction between different modules and components.
- **e2e**: End-to-end tests that simulate user scenarios and validate the entire application flow.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute all tests in the backend directory.

## Test Coverage

To ensure code quality and coverage, we utilize **Istanbul** for measuring test coverage. Coverage reports can be generated by running:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

## Best Practices

- Write tests for every new feature or bug fix.
- Keep tests isolated and independent from each other.
- Use descriptive names for test cases to clarify their purpose.
- Regularly run tests during development to catch issues early.

By following this testing strategy, we aim to maintain a robust and reliable backend for the MVC project.
